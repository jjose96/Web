# Git Project

A git project was created by Mubeena and added me(Joseph Jose) as one of the collaborators. as part of the developing team, I have cloned the project into my local system. And started working on it by adding project files into the repository. After adding commits are made and later push operation is performed. While performing push operation I faced an error:

```
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to '../remote/'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

The error occurred due to the failure to perform pull operation before performing push operation as my team made some changes on the repository in which I was not updated.

* ## Project Cloning

First of all, a separate folder is created for the project purpose and cloned the project into the working directory using the code 

```
git clone https://github.com/Mub96/group.git
```
